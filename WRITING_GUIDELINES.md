- **Math notes are not written for you now, but for you six months later.**
- **Each subsection should address a single question.**  
    Do not mix multiple definitions, theorems, examples, and proofs within the same subsection.
- **Place motivation and intuition in the main text, not inside theorem environments.**
- **Use Theorem, Proposition, Lemma, and Corollary consistently and correctly.**  
    A theorem states a chapter-level core result.  
    A proposition states a result of secondary importance.  
    A lemma is a technical result used to prove a theorem.  
    A corollary is a result that follows almost immediately from a preceding statement.
- **Introduce at most one new concept or notation per line.**
- **The first sentence of a proof must state the proof strategy.**
- **A proof should “close” before it formally ends.**  
    _This completes the proof._
- **Every example should explicitly state what it illustrates.**  
    _This example shows that the converse is false._
- **Number only what you intend to reference.**
- **Never introduce notation without linguistic guidance.**
